# NodeJS-Chat

This is a very basic Node JS / Socket.io chat application. It has very basic functionality / interface. Extending this app would be simple & so much could be done with it. Currently it is just a multi way conversation over using socket.io, the messages sent are not stored anywhere, this is something that could be added to extend the functionality.

# Usage

To use this application follow the instructions below:
 - Download + Install Node JS
 - Download the zip file + unzip it to a location of your choice (make a note of the location)
 - Go to the location & run the command `node index.js` (without quotations). You should see a message in the console saying `listening on *:3000`
 - Now browse to localhost:3000, when prompted type a username (This is to identify a user who sent the message)
 - Click in the message field & type a message. Once done click save. This should then send the message & it should appear in the chat area under the name field
