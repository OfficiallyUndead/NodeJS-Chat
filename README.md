# NodeJS-Chat

This is a very basic Node JS / Socket.io chat application. It has very basic functionality / interface. Extending this app would be simple & so much could be done with it. Currently it is just a multi way conversation over using socket.io, the messages sent are not stored anywhere, this is something that could be added to extend the functionality.
